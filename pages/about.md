## The Story So Far
Benjamin Booth and Ellen Brooks were married on April 12, 1865 at [Woods Chapel](http://www.woodschapel.armagh.anglican.org/en/home) in the parish of Ardtrea, County Londonderry, Ireland. Both of their parents were farmers. Benjamin was 19 at the time of the wedding; Ellen was 17.

Robert Petrie was born on December 5, 1865 to parents Andrew Petrie and Sarah Petrie (née Perry). The birth was registered in Belfast, County Antrim, Ireland. Andrew's occupation is listed as shoe maker.

Mary Booth was born on February 24, 1866 to parents Benjamin "Beu" Boothe and Esther Boothe. The birth was registered in Margherafelt, County Londonderry, Ireland. Benjamin's occupation is listed as labourer.

In the 1881 census, the Booths are listed as residing at [118 Parliamentary Road](https://maps.nls.uk/view/216810685#zoom=4.8&lat=1249&lon=2735&layers=BT) in the neighbourhood of St. Rollox, Lanarkshire, Scotland. Today, this area is part of the city of Glasgow.

Mary Booth was 15 at this time with two younger siblings, aged five and two. Her father's occupation is listed as a carter — someone who transports goods with a horse and cart. Mary's occupation is listed as [bookfolder](https://blog.library.si.edu/blog/2014/10/16/nineteenth-century-book-folders/), which was not an uncommon job for a young woman at the time.

In the same 1881 census, the Petries are listed as residing at [279 Dobbies Loan](https://maps.nls.uk/view/216810685#zoom=4.8&lat=1249&lon=2735&layers=BT) in the neighbourhood of St. Rollox, Lanarkshire, Scotland. Today, this area is part of the city of Glasgow.

Robert Petrie was 15 at this time with no younger siblings. His father's occupation is listed as shoemaker journeyman. Robert's occupation is listed as a plumber's apprentice.

The exact neighbourhood where Mary and Robert met was full of tenements and poorhouses, populated largely by Irish immigrants to the city. Due to post-WWII redevelopment, their exact addresses no longer exist.
